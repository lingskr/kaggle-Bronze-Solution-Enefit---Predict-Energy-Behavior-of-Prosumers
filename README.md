This repository contains a Jupyter notebook detailing the development of a machine learning model that won a bronze medal on Kaggle. The model leverages deep learning and gradient boosting techniques to optimize prediction accuracy through ensemble method coordination.

The goal of the competition is to create an energy prediction model of prosumers to reduce energy imbalance costs.

This competition aims to tackle the issue of energy imbalance, a situation where the energy expected to be used doesn't line up with the actual energy used or produced. Prosumers, who both consume and generate energy, contribute a large part of the energy imbalance. Despite being only a small part of all consumers, their unpredictable energy use causes logistical and financial problems for the energy companies.
